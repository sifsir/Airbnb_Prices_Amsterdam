## Breaking Down the Problem

In analyzing the selected dataset, I will use 6 questions to break down the problem for easier analysis.

**1.**
What type of property is most common among the top 10 property types in the Amsterdam Airbnb dataset, and what percentage does it represent of the total top property types?

**2:** 
How does the difference between the mean and median affect the interpretation of the property price distribution?

**3:**
What is the distribution of rating scores among the top 10 property types?

**4:**
Which areas have the highest and lowest average property prices?

**5:**
Based on the average rental prices according to the number of bedrooms in this dataset, is there a price trend with an increasing number of bedrooms?

**6:** 
Is the correlation between price and review_scores_rating statistically significant?

**7:** 
Are there significant price changes between properties hosted by superhosts and those not hosted by superhosts?
